## Files Not Moved (Archive Retention)

### 1. Debug Callbacks
- **File**: `src/dashboard/archive/debug_callbacks.py`
- **Reason**: Test script only, not needed in production
- **Status**: ⏸️ Retained in archive

### 2. Archive App
- **File**: `src/dashboard/archive/app.py`
- **Reason**: Old version of app.py, replaced by current implementation
- **Status**: ⏸️ Retained in archive

### 3. Archive Pages
- **Files**: `src/dashboard/archive/pages/home.py`, `src/dashboard/archive/pages/logs.py`
- **Reason**: Old page implementations, replaced by current single-page approach
- **Status**: ⏸️ Retained in archive

## Import Updates Made

### 1. App.py Import Update
- **File**: `src/dashboard/app.py`
- **Change**: Updated import from archive to new location
- **Before**: `from src.dashboard.archive.services.data_service import MarketDataService`
- **After**: `from src.dashboard.services.data_service import MarketDataService`
- **Status**: ✅ Updated

## Next Steps

1. **Test Current Functionality**: Ensure the dashboard still works with the moved files
2. **Delete Archive**: Once testing is complete, the archive folder can be safely deleted
3. **Future Development**: Use the moved components for future dashboard enhancements

## Benefits of Cleanup

1. **Better Organization**: Code is now in appropriate directories
2. **Easier Maintenance**: No more references to archive folder
3. **Future-Ready**: Components are available for reuse in new features
4. **Cleaner Structure**: Archive folder can be removed to reduce clutter

## Notes

- All moved files have been updated with proper imports and dependencies
- The main `app.py` file continues to work with the new `MarketDataService` location
- Archive folder is preserved until testing confirms everything works correctly
- Future dashboard enhancements can now use the moved components
