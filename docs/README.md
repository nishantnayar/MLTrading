## üìä Feature Engineering

### Architecture Overview

Our feature engineering system processes market data through three phases:

**Phase 1: Foundation Features (13)**
- Price returns and log returns
- Price ratios (high/close, low/close, etc.)
- Time-based features (hour, day of week, month)

**Phase 2: Core Technical Indicators (23)**
- Moving averages (SMA/EMA: 12, 24, 120, 480 periods)
- Volatility measures (rolling std, ATR)
- Bollinger Bands (20-period, 2 std dev)
- MACD (12/26/9 configuration)

**Phase 3: Advanced ML Features (54+)**
- **RSI Multi-timeframe**: 1d, 3d, 1w, 2w, EMA-based
- **Volume Indicators**: Volume oscillator, price-volume trend
- **Intraday Features**: Daily reference points
- **Lagged Features**: 1h, 2h, 4h, 8h, 24h lags
- **Rolling Statistics**: 6h, 12h, 24h windows

### RSI Calculation

Optimized for intraday data (7 records/day):
```python
RSI_WINDOWS = {
    'rsi_1d': 7,         # 1 day (~7 intraday records)
    'rsi_3d': 21,        # 3 days
    'rsi_1w': 35,        # 1 week (5 trading days)
    'rsi_2w': 70         # 2 weeks (10 trading days)
}
```

### Usage

```python
# Process single symbol with comprehensive features
from src.data.processors.feature_engineering import FeatureEngineerPhase1And2
engineer = FeatureEngineerPhase1And2()
success = engineer.process_symbol_phase3_comprehensive("AAPL", initial_run=True)

# Bulk processing
python scripts/feature_engineering_processor.py
```

### Database Schema

**Key Tables:**
- `market_data`: OHLCV data with timestamps
- `feature_engineered_data`: All calculated features (90+ columns)
- Connection pooling for optimal performance
