- 8GB+ RAM recommended for full symbol processing

### Initial Setup
```bash
# 1. Deploy complete data and features (one-time setup)
python deployments/complete_data_and_features_ondemand.py

# 2. Start production data collection
python deployments/yahoo_production_deployment.py

# 3. Start production feature engineering  
python deployments/feature_engineering_production_deployment.py
```

**Key Components**:
- **Data Sources**: Yahoo Finance API with 3-day rolling windows
- **Processing Engine**: Subprocess isolation for 100% reliability
- **Storage**: PostgreSQL with optimized schemas and indexing
- **Feature Engineering**: 36 technical indicators including MA, MACD, RSI, Bollinger Bands
- **API Layer**: FastAPI backend with async/await support
- **Frontend**: Professional trading dashboard with interactive charts

## Production Deployment

The system uses a three-tier deployment strategy:

1. **Complete Setup** (Manual): Full historical data and feature backfill
2. **Data Collection** (Hourly): Incremental Yahoo Finance data during market hours  
3. **Feature Engineering** (Hourly+5min): Real-time technical indicator calculation

All deployments are configured through `deployments/prefect.yaml` and monitored via `config/deployments_config.yaml`.

## Support
